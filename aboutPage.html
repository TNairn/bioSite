                Anna Thompson is a 21-year-old student at Colorado State University. 
                She is pursuing a degree in computer science and is looking to enter 
                the tech industry when she finishes school. She was born in Killeen, 
                Texas, but quickly moved to Colorado where she has lived since she was 
                a baby. Growing up, she had many opportunities to develop her hobbies 
                and interests, which now include painting, crocheting, and swimming.

                In school, she has always achieved good grades, and was active in 
                extracurricular activities such as marching band. She attributes her 
                fondest school memories to her time spent in marching band where she 
                met many of her friends. As she entered college at Colorado State 
                University, she was originally planning on pursuing a medical degree, 
                taking inspiration from her younger brother who has dealt with health 
                issues since he was born. However, she soon decided that a different 
                path would be a better fit and switched her major to pursue a computer 
                science degree. She has developed a love for programming and is excited 
                to apply her skills to an area of the industry that she is passionate 
                about; Perhaps an application that relates to the medical field.

                Apart from her career goals, Anna has become more focused than ever on 
                her physical health. Regular workouts and stretching have become part 
                of her weekly routine. She hopes to maintain her strength and 
                flexibility in order to keep up her ability to do the activities she 
                loves such as hiking and skiing.
